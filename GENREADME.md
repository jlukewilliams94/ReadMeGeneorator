## Project Description
### Why did I build this project?
* The purpose of this project was to dynamically create a read me using npm Inquirer, Axios and Node.js. By creating a javascript template I will be able to run "node index.js" for any project I create and generate a descriptive read me. 
### What problems does this project overcome?
* I will allow users to create uniform read me files for any project they create. They will also be able to change the questions prompted in the index.js to prompt questions more specific to their project. 
### What new skills did I learn?
* I learned how to use JSON packages such as Inquirer, and Axios and store the information from those functions to dynamically create an new file and display the inforamtionn gathered from both packages. I also learned to use node to review code without using inspect in Google Chrome.
